# Premise

###   Due to personal reasons, I wasn't able to follow the course every day. However during the last weeks, I've been able to feel like a Programmer, for the following reasons:
1. I've finished the first module and first MS project, even with a Limited amount of time, and a very strict deadline.  
1. I've learned how, in this job, is important to learn how to work SMARTER, and not harder! (if you know what i mean!)
1. Not to be excused for what it will be my final result but, I've worked many hours to finish my project, with lots of Joy and Coffee!
4. Last but not least: lots of meme about coding! here's the meme that my girlfriend created for me during this last week ðŸ˜‚:

- Anyhow, enjoy the README file, and keep coding!
